# NFT-Minter
NFT minter- full stack; to add a link, name, description of a image and mint it as an NFT with Meta data, using contract already deployed on the network
This Repo is a follow up of the tutorial by youtuber- Eat The Blocks.

This repo make use of Alchemy and Pinata, for the development.

Neither the `minter-starter-files` nor the `nft-tutorial` have their `node_modules` folder. So before running `npm start` in your terminal to start the React project, you need to run `npm install` to download all the package dependencies.
